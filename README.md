# Process-Automation
This project focused on helping customer service associates shift their attenion away from manual data processes and over to servicing the customers. 

While customer services associates should be focused on servicing customer inquiries, there are tasks that detract their attention away from customers. These tasks are typically centered around the data thats produced when customers place orders online. One of those tasks involves uploading shipment tracking numbers, so customers are aware of where there orders are.
